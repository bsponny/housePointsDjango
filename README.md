# House Points Django

## Overview
This is a Django Application to keep track of Hogwarts House Points. You use it by selecting the House you wish to add/subtract points for on the drop down list, then select whether to add or subtract 10 or 5 points, then click `GO`. This will then update the screen to show you how many points each house has.

## TODO:
* Reorder the Houses based on the order of points. Make them side by side when there's a tie and on top of each other for winning
